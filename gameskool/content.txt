<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: #feff94;">Let's face it</span></span>, millions of people play video games on a daily basis and a lot of these people need help with said video games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />People like you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />So, you turn to FAQ sites or buy walkthroughs and guides, but for some inexplicable reason, you don't realize these sites and walkthroughs are all in TEXT. C'mon people, don't you think there should be an easier way? We live in the 21st century! More and more households have broadband, we have internet access in the palm of our friggin' hands, a black US President, Pinkberry AND Red Mango, and yet you're still wading through tons of text just to get help on a certain section of a particular video game. Do you still send your mail by carrier pigeon, too?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, why aren't there any videos that can just show me how to get past this part?!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ah, but there are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why can't I find it???"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because they are unorganized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"ARGHHH!!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As fellow gamers ourselves, we at GameProtege know how you feel. This site was developed to give everyone easy access to video game walkthroughs/guides/FAQs/strategies in streaming video format. No more having to sift through enormous blocks of text just to solve a frustrating puzzle. Every video is sorted and categorized properly according to Title/Genre/System, etc. No more having to go through a bunch of useless videos before you find the one you're actually looking for. What makes it even better is that almost all content is user submitted and editable by users. Videos can also be voted up or voted down by users, depending on how useful the video is, so no need to wonder if that certain video will be helpful or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"WTF? <span style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: #feff94;">This site is awesome!</span></span>"<br /><br />We know.</p>
