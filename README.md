# Gaming Videos Indexing And Search

This site was conceptualized and built in 2011.  I was a big video gamer back then, and was inspired by watching YouTube gaming videos, gaming FAQ sites, and Reddit.  I thought it would be nice to have a gamefaqs like site, but with video tutorials, tips, and secrets.  It would follow a Reddit model where users submitted and commented / voted on videos.  Revenue can be generated with ads and game system repairs.  A friend of mine had a game system repair service and I could integrate orders with his service.

So, I designed and developed this site, including art via Photoshop, offically named it GameProtege, and started categorizing and indexing helpful gaming videos from YouTube.  I designed and built a relevancy and sorting algorithm, and even built a script that would automatically look for and pull videos from games that were set up.  And then, my ability to plan, design, and build a site way outpaced my ability to market, and momentum fell apart.
